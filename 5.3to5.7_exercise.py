"""
5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
 variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
 Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message
 that the player just earned 5 points.
 Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The
 version that fails will have no output.)
 5-4. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write
 an if-else chain.
 If the alienâ€™s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for
 shooting the alien.
 If the alienâ€™s color isnâ€™t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
 Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else
 block.
 5-5. Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-elif-else
 chain.
 If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
 If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
 If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
 Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the
 appropriate color alien.
 5-6. Stages of Life: Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a personâ€™s stage of
 life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:
 If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
 If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a
 toddler.
 If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is
 a kid.
 If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person
 is a teenager.
 If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person
 is an adult.
 If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
 5-7. Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
 independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
 Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your
 list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as You really
 like bananas!
